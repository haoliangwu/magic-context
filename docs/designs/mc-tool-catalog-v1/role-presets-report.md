# ck-mc role catalog update

## Served table

These are the base sets; existing configuration and request filters still apply.
Only `composition.compaction.provider == "magic-context"` means compacting.
Missing compaction or another provider means not compacting; null is malformed.

| Role | Not compacting | Compacting |
|---|---|---|
| head | `ctx_note`, `ctx_memory`, `ctx_search`; existing tools-only text | All five tools; existing primary text |
| worker | No tools; empty text | `ctx_reduce`, `ctx_expand`, `ctx_search`; existing subagent text |
| reader | No tools; empty text | Same as worker |

Aliases, from the one shared definition table: `primary` → `head`, `subagent` →
`worker`, `tools-only` → `head`. They do not imply compaction. An omitted preset
defaults to head. OpenCode and Pi plugin tool/guidance paths are unchanged.
`role.describe` keeps the shared contract's build-only discovery shape.

## Refusal contract for the gateway

- Unknown catalog or call preset: `invalid_request`, message
  `Magic Context defines no preset "<name>"`, detail `{"field":"preset"}`.
  This follows commons 0.5.0 and its unmodified conformance suite. The initial
  brief's `preset_unserved` was superseded by the parent decision to follow the
  shared contract; no new error code was introduced.
- Worker/reader `ctx_memory` call: `unknown_tool`, message
  `no tool named ctx_memory`, detail `{"tool":"ctx_memory"}`.
- Worker/reader `ctx_note` call: `unknown_tool`, message
  `no tool named ctx_note`, detail `{"tool":"ctx_note"}`.
- Role-admitted non-compacting session's `ctx_reduce`: `unknown_tool`, message
  `no tool named ctx_reduce`, detail `{"tool":"ctx_reduce"}`.

The named call refusals use the role's existing code for a tool not served by
the requested catalog. They occur before resolving or mutating the store, even
if Claude Code exposes the head's tool list to its subagents. Tests drive real
write arguments through dispatch, verify the store remains empty after each
helper refusal, and verify head calls write successfully with and without
compaction. Full catalog fetches with a composition retain process-local state
for the session's bound routes; preflight, digest-only and failed fetches cannot
replace it. A call carrying a fleet preset before any such fetch cannot gain
`ctx_reduce` by claiming compaction in its own envelope. Calls with neither a
preset nor a frozen catalog retain the legacy path regardless of the route's
declared role versions.

### Legacy Claude Code bridge

Read-only inspection of subconscious `crates/subc-mcp/src/main.rs` (checkout
HEAD `1a14993c120725fa1dce7267b6e7d0823835930c`) confirms:

- `open_provider_route` calls `open_route`, whose `RouteOpen` sets
  `role_versions: None` (line 2700). The bridge does not currently declare
  `tool-provider/v1`. This absence is no longer a requirement for legacy calls:
  declaring the role alone cannot switch admission to a non-compacting head.
- `route_tool_call_request` carries `preset: None`; the protocol serializer
  omits absent presets. A planless MCP call never asserts compaction.
- MCP `list_tools` reads `state.exposed_tools()`. These originate in subc's
  control-plane `catalog.list` manifest roles: `desired_session_from_catalog`
  clones `ProviderRole::ToolProvider.tools`, namespaces the names, and preserves
  each schema. `mcp_tool_from_exposed` copies the schema object into MCP
  `inputSchema`. It does not call Magic Context's `tool.catalog`.
- Magic Context's startup `manifest` uses
  `prompt_surface::module_tools(PromptSurfaceSelection::default())`. This path
  is unchanged, still advertising `ctx_reduce` with the legacy schema along
  with the other facade tools (subject to bridge policy).

Existing Broca facade goldens already pin the legacy full/light arrays and
their equivalence to the startup manifest. The additional
`legacy_bridge_startup_ctx_reduce_schema_bytes_are_pinned` test pins the exact
startup reduce schema serialization, including description bytes, against an
independent literal. `planless_calls_keep_legacy_response_bytes_even_on_a_v1_declaring_route`
drives a Claude Code-profile transform to mint valid tags, then executes
`ctx_reduce`, `ctx_memory` and `ctx_note` without presets or a catalog. All three
succeed on a v1-declaring route, including real memory/note writes, with responses
byte-identical to a legacy non-declaring route. An omitted call preset still
cannot bypass an already fetched non-compacting catalog.

**Future Broca compaction prerequisite, reported but not fixed:**
`frozen_tool_catalogs` is process-local and is lost on ck-mc restart (also when
the session's last route closes). Broca does not re-fetch its frozen plan on
resume. Current non-compacting Broca sessions are unaffected, but a future
compacting Broca head call carrying `preset: head` after a restart has no frozen
record, is treated as not compacting, and `ctx_reduce` is refused. Before Magic
Context serves as Broca's compaction provider, this record must be durable or
re-derivable from the session's frozen plan. No persistence, schema or migration
change is included here.

**Deferred guidance sentence:** commons `CatalogRequest` has only `params`,
`preset`, `composition`, `system_text` and `digest_only`. It has no actual
model-visible tool set. `composition.providers` records admitted provider tools,
not a separate shared head visibility set; ck-mc requires its entry to match the
tools it serves. Thalamus HEAD's `guidance_client.rs` still calls legacy
`guidance.get` with `serializer_profile`, `variant` and the single `ctx_reduce`
`tool_present` boolean. Per the parent decision, no new field or warning sentence
was invented. The proposed future catalog argument is `present_tools: string[]`;
agreement with Thalamus is pending. Worker/reader text therefore continues not
to mention `ctx_memory` or `ctx_note`. No schema, migration or epoch changed.

## Digests

Before is Magic Context base `2ea196d0eeaccbdcd8456114716aeadaea067691`.

`text_revision`:

- Before: `688e3ccf33d746625eb3c7002027f74ab0eb5c78e658bfa1175594421a9a8602`
- After: `ed57523e4298f1ab7644ca0552947eea8554945e06f113b5a172eab44063ce00`

The revision moves because the shared definition now includes role-named
guidance templates. Rendered legacy wording remains byte-identical. Every
existing text's `item_digest` is unchanged. `preflight_digest` changes with the
role spelling and text revision; exact values are in each answer JSON.
All structural tool-schema digests remain unchanged, including frozen
`ctx_reduce` at `69c7dd3393dc8af19386eb80f849df7a1943126bfe1a14769bfff1182b88abf6`.

Composition digests change only for the compacting examples (the frozen
compaction item, and worker's removal of memory/note tools):

| Examples | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| primary/head full and light | `1563f27857ccc582af048c3dd534592d635e9e0c7f8d0422f5cec87d7cd54b0d` | `c7dd640f65180d13af85feec11f66b90b7a184ef351485c4e68c7b974be5cb1c` |

## Prefrontal `22d9b3dafa95`

Check command:
`MC_CATALOG_PREFRONTAL_REF=22d9b3dafa95 bun docs/designs/mc-tool-catalog-v1/generate.ts --check`.
`PREFRONTAL_REF`'s default remains unchanged (`804ada4d283f244d54c3d06adb3d521fad4aa292`).
The sibling is read-only; vector trees and content are loaded with `git show`.

23 canonical JSON/digest vectors checked: 17 pass, 6 fail plan compatibility
by design. All 23 retain correct JCS/SHA-256 bytes and Magic Context capability
tags. The no-compaction head's composition digest is
`e5d6c646c78f48fe16b1e3f3d1ee8a656f7bbd5447ba6b8b02a4837d44c4d3a7`.
The commons cross-check passes 16 digest vectors; its two floating-point vectors
are skipped by the generator's existing integer-only canonicalizer.

Passing compositions (all 11): `broca-head-no-compaction`,
`broca-head-optional-text`, `broca-head-plexus-direct`,
`broca-head-plexus-no-exclude`, `broca-head`, `broca-worker-unknown-provider`,
`broca-worker`, `pre-tool-declared`, `pre-tool-tightened`, `pre-tool-two-phase`,
`text-only-and-hook-only`. A composition alone has no plan preset to validate.

Passing plans (6): `broca-head-no-compaction`, `broca-head-optional-text`,
`broca-head-plexus-direct`, `broca-head-plexus-no-exclude`,
`broca-head-text-reordered`, `broca-head`.

Failing plans (6):

- `broca-worker-unknown-provider`, `broca-worker`: Magic Context `tool_items`
  preset `worker` without Magic Context compaction.
- `pre-tool-declared`, `pre-tool-tightened`, `pre-tool-two-phase`,
  `text-only-and-hook-only`: Magic Context `step_transform_items` preset
  `worker` without Magic Context compaction.

Each error says to omit that item. The check enforces the rule on actual plan
item arrays, including hooks, rather than only on the two worker filenames.
No Prefrontal file or ref was changed. Our own example check uses
`bun docs/designs/mc-tool-catalog-v1/generate.ts --examples-only --check`:
11 examples, 44 generated files, 512 Rust/TypeScript guidance parity cases.

## Compatibility-fence mutation controls

Both mutations were explicitly marked `NON-VACUITY BREAK`, applied after staging
the live generator, and restored with `git checkout -- <path> && touch <path>`.

- Neutralize the non-compacting helper guard: only
  `fetch-plan compatibility fence > plan refuses non-compacting Magic Context worker and reader items`
  fails (14 tests still pass). During diff: generator, 1 insertion/1 deletion;
  after restore: empty diff.
- Swallow the plan's unknown-preset refusal: only
  `fetch-plan compatibility fence > plan refuses a Magic Context preset it does not serve`
  fails (14 tests still pass). During diff: generator, 4 insertions/1 deletion;
  after restore: empty diff.

In each run the other two fence tests remained green. All twelve role-catalog
tests remained green: the nine `head|worker|reader with no|other-module|magic-context
compaction` cells, `aliases name roles, never select compaction`,
`catalog refuses an unknown preset by name`, and
`compaction is optional but never null or malformed`.
