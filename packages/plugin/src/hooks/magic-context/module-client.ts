/**
 * Build the subc-backed module client every host lane uses to reach `ck-mc`.
 *
 * Two adapters need the identical client: the OpenCode 1 server lane and the
 * OpenCode 2 setup lane. Building it in one place is what stops the two from
 * drifting — a method added for one host would otherwise silently be missing on
 * the other, and the difference would only show up as "Rust module status
 * unavailable" on whichever lane was forgotten.
 *
 * Constructing the transport is inert: it opens no connection until a call is
 * actually made, so a lane may build the client before it knows whether this
 * session will use it.
