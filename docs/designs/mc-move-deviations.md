# Magic Context move inventory and confirmed protocol deviations

## Inventory boundary

`crates/mc-store/src/move_inventory.rs` pins inventory version **1**, context.db
schema **95**, and store.db schema **63**. Its explicit table/column census was
generated from `initializeDatabase` followed by `runMigrations` on a new context
database, and `McStore::open` on a new store database. The census uses
`sqlite_master` plus `PRAGMA table_xinfo`, not historical `CREATE TABLE` text or
the pre-single-store schema. It contains **106 context tables** and **32 store
tables**, including FTS virtual tables, their hidden columns and shadow tables.
Store migration 61's dropped domain tables are absent. Context's still-present
legacy authority/mirror tables are explicitly `not_session`, not shipped.

This module is deliberately standalone/path-importable. Wiring it into mc-store
and the exporter belongs to the move API implementation. The exporter must call
`validate_schema` on **both capture read transactions**, before reading row data
or admitting any record, and separately enforce the pinned schema versions.
An unknown table, with or without `session_id`, or any unknown column (including
on an excluded table or a generated column) returns
`inventory_unclassified {store, table, column?}`. Discovery never grants shipping.
Missing tables/columns remain schema-version/install validation concerns; this
drift fence specifically detects additions not reviewed by the inventory.

SQLite owns the `sqlite_` namespace: all such tables are fixed `not_session`
exceptions and are never snapshot/render inputs. The census explicitly contains
`sqlite_sequence` in both stores and context's `sqlite_stat1`. `ANALYZE` can add
store's `sqlite_stat1`, optional `sqlite_stat4`, or another SQLite-internal table
without failing the drift fence. `cortexkit_schema_version`, context's
`single_store_state`, and store's `mc_privilege_state` are explicit
`not_session` entries as well. The marker is local consistency evidence, not a
session row to import.

### Session classification

The code is the complete ordered field list; the following records the policy:

| Store | Class | Tables |
|---|---|---|
| context | ship | `session_meta`, `tags`, `pending_ops`, `source_contents`, `tool_owner_backfill_state`, `compartments`, `compartment_events`, `compartment_history_versions`, `session_facts`, `compression_depth`, session-only `notes`, `transform_decisions`, `temporal_decisions`, `session_replay_decisions`, `m0_mutation_log`, `historian_runs`, `recomp_compartments`, `recomp_facts`, `subagent_invocations`, `plugin_messages`, `lkg_slots`, `lkg_slot_chunks`, `session_projects` |
| context | rebuild | `compartment_chunk_embeddings`, `message_history_fts` and its five shadow tables, `message_fts_rowid_map`, `message_history_source`, `message_history_index` |
| context | local_reset | `compartment_state_lease`, `synapse_batch_ledger`, `embedding_measurement_corpus`, `user_memory_candidates`, `primer_candidates`, `pending_session_cleanup` |
| store | ship | `mc_cache_state`, `mc_cache_frozen_chunks`, `mc_cache_sections`, `mc_compartment_dates`, `mc_tags`, `mc_tag_cache_generations`, `pending_agent_drops`, `mc_reduce_command_ledger`, `mc_channel1_appends`, `mc_user_hints`, `mc_temporal_marks`, `mc_overlay_frontiers`, `mc_wrapup_commands`, `mc_recomp_commands`, `mc_pass_trace`, `mc_pass_trace_history`, `mc_chunk_transcripts`, `mc_state_imports`, `mc_transform_session_roots`, `mc_served_output_fingerprints`, `mc_block_identities`, `shadow_divergences`, `mc_historian_side_channel_outbox`, `mc_facade_mutation_ledger` |
| store | local_reset | `mc_historian_pending_run`, `mc_single_store_pending_publish` (both must drain to empty before capture), `mc_cache_state_digest`, `mc_dream_task_commands` |
| both | not_session | Every remaining **explicitly named** census entry; not a runtime catch-all |

All 34 `SESSION_SCOPED_TABLES` from the frozen inventory evidence are covered.
Predicates select by session only, across **all** harness values (including
`opencode:rust`); notes additionally require `type = 'session'`. A shadow table
has no independent session predicate: its `ShadowOf` entry delegates ownership
and destination-populated checks to `message_history_fts`. Neither its rows nor
hidden FTS control columns are shipped.

`mc_facade_mutation_ledger` is session-owned despite lacking a column literally
named `session_id`: the facade passes its `conversation_key` as `identity_scope`
to `with_facade_command`. Its predicate is `identity_scope = ?1`. Omitting this
ledger would silently remove command idempotency. `mc_privilege_state` is the
singleton machine privilege/single-store marker. `mc_project_mural_artifacts`
is project-keyed, not session-owned. The other previously undecided tables,
`shadow_divergences` and `mc_historian_side_channel_outbox`, hold `session_id` and
ship; no served-byte equivalence proof licenses dropping them.

Every entry lists columns in `table_xinfo` order and primary keys in PK order.
`shipped_columns` returns only a ship entry's columns minus its explicit deny
list. **No current shipped column is denied**: opaque rendered requests and
replay/decision documents are intentional session state, and this inventory does
not invent omissions that might alter served bytes. The class `deny` and
per-column deny lists are available for reviewed future fields. `credential`
is not an entry in either store: the exporter must never open `opencode.db`.
This slice supplies classification tests, not the later exporter's credential
sentinel or file-permission proofs.

Session-composite keys use `Preserve`. Store-wide surrogate keys (including
context tags, notes, compartment/history/event/run ids and store pending-drop
ids) use `PreserveOrRefuseCollision`: a collision must refuse `key_collision`
before either half is installed. This is the conservative preserve policy,
**not** a claim that remapping is safe. No key is designated `reassign` until
round-trip/collision tests prove it absent from served bytes and enumerate SQL
and embedded-JSON references (e.g. `source_contents.tag_id` and
`pending_ops.tag_id`). `mc_tags` is first in the store inventory so the later
installer can apply its triggers before finalizing the shipped generation.

The served marker and `lkg_slots.served_capture_id` do not exist at these schema
heads. Their migration must update this inventory and version; adding a
speculative entry now would conceal whether the real schema was classified.

### Render-input closure

Render inputs stay `not_session`: selecting them for a digest never ships
memories. `RenderScope` must reuse the host's
`resolveModuleWorkspaceContext` result, the pass's expiry cutoff and its
workspace fingerprint. It does not implement an alternative identity resolver.
The selectors cover `loadModuleWatermarks` and the data its watermarks describe:

| Table | `render_input` selector |
|---|---|
| `project_state` | Session project, canonical workspace members (their epochs feed the fingerprint), and `GLOBAL_USER_PROFILE_PROJECT_PATH = '__global__'` |
| `memories` | Active/permanent, unexpired rows under `expandedIdentities`; own identities bypass sharing restrictions, foreign identities require `shareCategories`, `shareable = 1`, and project/ecosystem/universe scope |
| `memory_mutation_log` | **All** rows under `expandedIdentities`, without a category/status filter; hidden/expired/deleted transitions still advance the mutation cursor |
| `workspaces` | Workspace row(s) anchored by the session project, including sharing categories |
| `workspace_members` | Every member of those anchored workspaces, not unrelated workspaces |
| `v22_identity_rekey_map` | Aliases whose new identity is a canonical workspace identity, needed to reconstruct expansion and own-identity membership |
| `user_memories` | Active global user-profile content; its version is the global project-state row above |

The digest encoder must include the resolved fingerprint as a separate value,
distinguishing null/no workspace from a fingerprint. `render_input_rowids`
selects rows in primary-key order for a later encoder; it does not yet compute a
digest. Shipped compartments, session metadata and m0 mutation rows already
cover the session-owned watermark inputs. Docs/tool/system/model identity
markers are separate render-identity components, not memory-id watermarks.

## ENGRAM-confirmed dispositions

The frozen protocol snapshot (`agent-move-session-protocol-snapshot.md`, lines
14–19, 44–50, 56–66 and 86–94) remains the starting protocol evidence.
**ENGRAM's decisions relayed by the engineering chair override the reviewed
move spec where the two differ.** In particular, file-path import and a HARD
fold for any memory difference are **not approved**. These are interface/design
pins for subsequent implementation, not APIs implemented by the inventory.

1. **Prepare arguments — approved with an opaque host cut.** Engram owns
   `mcStartOffset` (the mc stream's durable end) and passes it. The host fields
   travel as one verbatim, opaque `hostCut` object, at most **64 KiB**. Engram
   binds its digest into the cut record. `hostInputs` is `{count, digest}` over
   the ordered message-id/digest projection, **never the list itself**. MC
   computes message digests at ingestion so prepare compares without re-reading
   the host transcript. Neither MC nor engram invents a `sessionRef` derivation.
2. **Import transport — changed; release approved.** Import pulls staged chunks
   through engram's
   `session.read {sessionRef, stream: 'mc', cutId, fromOffset}`, restricted to the
   caller's own stream, rather than accepting a records file path. Release is
   idempotent per `cutId`: `seal` on activation, `abort` on move abort, `discard`
   for a conflicting staged import. Capture/staging storage still needs private
   local files. The required engram `session.read` path is not implemented in
   this repository/base; there is no compatibility shim or invented local
   substitute. Engram must provide that path before import integration.
3. **Consistency — approved.** A fence held across **both stores**, recorded in
   the manifest, replaces the removed authority-generation pair. Migration 61
   removed that machinery, so emitting fictitious generations is not a fallback.
4. **Render differences — narrowed; `render_state_mismatch` confirmed.** Only a
   render-**format** difference (another binary's render epochs) forces exactly
   one durable HARD fold, without the LKG or served marker. A different memory
   set or docs does **not** fold: the carried head replays unchanged. Instead,
   imported memory watermarks and memory-mutation-log positions are marked
   **foreign**; m[1] adds **no memory deltas** until the next natural HARD fold
   re-baselines against destination memories. Docs change only on a natural
   rebuild. Every other differing component refuses
   `render_state_mismatch {components}`, writing nothing live. Thus the reviewed
   spec's eager fold for memory differences and unconditional `epoch_mismatch`
   expectation require corresponding later acceptance-test changes, not silent
   reinterpretation. Memory ids remain machine-local until memory sync exists.
5. **Paths — approved with a second check.** Identical repository paths are a
   precondition; absolute operational paths ship unchanged, with MC's refusal
   as a second check. `dir:` project identities remain non-portable and refused.
6. **Embeddings — approved.** Always rebuild embeddings, **never** block the
   first turn on the rebuild; search is degraded until it finishes.

**Surface confirmed:** ck-mc `session.move.prepare`, `session.move.import`, and
`session.move.release` over subc. In production engram calls as
`reserved:engram`. Prepare and release are restricted to that caller, plus a
direct operator caller for development. Every op is idempotent per `cutId` and
returns typed refusals with metadata in error `detail`. Host fences, activation
records, and Broca support remain outside this MC inventory implementation.

### Shared hostCut digest rule (BROCA / ENGRAM / MC confirmed)

The shared combination rule is SHA-256 over, in ordinal order, the UTF-8 bytes
of each message's `mid + "\n" + messageDigest + "\n"` concatenated together.
Each per-message digest is exactly **64 lowercase hexadecimal characters**.
A `mid` containing `"\n"` makes prepare refuse; it is **never escaped**.

`hostInputs` contains the count of messages through the sealed position and the
combined digest. `lastMessageId` is the last sealed `mid`. An empty session has
`count: 0`, `lastMessageId: null`, and SHA-256 of the empty string:
`e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`.
`sessionId` is a JSON **object** `{project_root, session, harness}`, not a tuple.

For Broca, `mid` is the message id returned by `session.read`. A per-message
digest hashes RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical bytes of the entry's `message` object
**exactly as served**, excluding `ordinal`, `mid`, and the `tool_calls` dispatch
annotations outside that object. OpenCode and Pi hash their own per-host message
shape inside MC's adapter; the count/ordered-id-and-digest-lines combination is
shared by all hosts. The pinned Broca three-message vector (objects, mids,
per-message digests and combined digest) is pending Broca's commit and must be
pinned byte-for-byte by a later slice; this inventory does not fabricate it.

## Verification and reproduction

Embedded tests run the actual current Bun migration chain and `McStore::open`
against throwaway databases under the worktree's ignored `target/` directory.
They compare every live table, every `table_xinfo` column and every PK with the
checked-in inventory, exercise all six A2 drift cases, excluded/generated-column
drift and `ANALYZE`, and select independently seeded memory/workspace/profile
sentinels. They also check the live 34-table session list, all-harness predicates,
session-only notes, and facade-ledger ownership.

Until mc-store exposes this module, create an **ignored**, worktree-local harness
at `target/move-inventory-harness/` with this `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "move-inventory-harness"
version = "0.0.0"
edition = "2021"

[workspace]

[dependencies]
mc-store = { path = "../../crates/mc-store", features = ["test-support"] }
cortexkit-store-types = "=0.2.2"
rusqlite = { version = "0.32", features = ["bundled"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
tempfile = "3"
```

Its `src/main.rs` is:

```rust
pub use mc_store::{McStore, LATEST_MIGRATION_VERSION};
#[path = "../../../crates/mc-store/src/move_inventory.rs"]
pub mod move_inventory;
fn main() {}
```

From the worktree root, with the repository's installed Bun dependencies:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path target/move-inventory-harness/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path target/move-inventory-harness/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
rustfmt --edition 2021 --check crates/mc-store/src/move_inventory.rs
```

The standalone file needs the explicit rustfmt check because it is not yet in
the library's module graph. When migrations change, obtain a new live census,
review every new table/column's class and ownership, update the version pins and
explicit entries, then rerun the fresh-migration equality and drift tests. Do not
generate shipping policy from a column-name or table-name pattern.
