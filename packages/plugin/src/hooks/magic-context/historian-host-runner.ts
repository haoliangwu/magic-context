/**
 * The host half of the `historian.runner: "host"` lane.
 *
 * The module owns everything about a fold except the model call: it decides when
 * to fire, assembles the chunk, builds the prompt, validates the answer and runs
 * the publish CAS. When the runner is `host` it stops short of the completion and
 * queues the assembled request instead. This is what takes those queued runs and
 * answers them.
 *
 * One loop serves every session this process has open, because a claimant
 * discovers runs by polling rather than by already knowing which session produced
 * them. The four operations it uses are the module's management ops, pinned by
 * `crates/mc-module/testdata/historian-claim-wire-golden.json`:
 *
 *   historian.pending    what is waiting for a claimant
 *   historian.claim      take one, under an attempt and token the module mints
 *   historian.heartbeat  say the claim is still alive
 *   historian.complete   the terminal report: one text, or one failure
 *
 * Three rules shape everything below.
 *
 * 1. **Refusals are ordinary.** Losing a claim race, or holding a token that was
 *    replaced, is normal operation for a poller. The answer is always to move on
 *    to the next run, never to retry the same attempt: the module mints the
 *    attempt and the token, so a claimant cannot re-present a claim it has lost.
 *    A refused HEARTBEAT is the one that ends a run in flight: whatever the code,
 *    it means the claim this host is working under is over, so the completion is
 *    abandoned and nothing is reported.
 *
 * 2. **A slow run must not block an unrelated one.** A completion legitimately
 *    takes minutes. Claims are therefore started and then left to run on their
 *    own, so a fold for one session never delays claiming a run for another.
 *
 * 3. **One claim per session at a time.** The module allows one firing per
 *    session anyway; taking a second here would spend a provider call on a run
 *    whose report could never be admitted.
 *
 * The loop is per project, and its requests ride a route bound to that project.
 * The module scopes the lane to the caller's binding, so an unbound caller is
 * refused and a bound one only ever sees its own project's runs. That matters
 * here for more than tidiness: a claim hands back the folded transcript, so a
 * loop that could poll across projects could read another project's
 * conversation.
