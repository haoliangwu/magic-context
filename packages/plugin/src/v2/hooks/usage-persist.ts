/**
 * Record the usage OpenCode stored for the latest completed reply.
 *
 * The reading is the prompt size of a request the provider accepted, so it is
 * real pressure at any size. It is never compared with the configured window:
 * that window can be smaller than what the model actually serves, and a reading
 * past it is real overflow of the user's limit for the scheduler to handle.
 *
 * A reading never refuses the next request by itself. However high it is, the
 * next transform pass has to run, because that pass is the only thing that can
 * shrink the session (the force band's queued drops and emergency reclaim, the
 * historian, a fold). Refusing on the reading would leave it unchanged and
 * refuse again on every later turn. The transform refuses only after its own
 * pass, and only when the provider has rejected the request as too large and
 * that pass folded nothing, the same rule OpenCode 1 and Pi follow.
