/**
 * Worker-thread entry that applies pending schema migrations to context.db.
 *
 * A migration can rewrite hundreds of megabytes inside one SQLite transaction,
 * which takes seconds to tens of seconds on a large store. SQLite calls are
 * synchronous, so on the host's main thread that time froze the host: OpenCode
 * stopped answering `/health` and a supervisor could kill it. Here the work runs
 * on its own thread with its own connection, with exactly the code the main
 * thread used to run (`initializeDatabase` then `runMigrationsWithRetry`). So each
 * migration still takes SQLite's write lock with BEGIN IMMEDIATE, a version another
 * process applied first is still skipped, and a failed migration still rolls back
 * and fails the open. The caller (migration-worker-client.ts) runs the schema fence
 * and the old-holder guard before starting this worker and the fence again after it
 * finishes.
