 * session folds before the host's own trigger is ever reached — so on the normal
 * path there is no host cut and this is the ONLY thing that keeps a folded
 * session from handing the module its whole history again on every later turn.
 * Measured with it removed: the array handed to the module grew from 15 to 53
 * messages over twenty post-fold turns while the boundary stood still.
 *
 * It is silent when the host HAS cut, because the boundary message is then
 * already gone from the array. An earlier pass mutated it under a fixture whose
 * mock reported a constant usage — which kept the host compacting on every turn,
 * and therefore always cutting — and concluded from the silence that it never
 * fires at all.
 *
 * Returns the number of messages removed. A boundary that is not in the array is
 * left alone: it either has not been reached yet or belongs to history the host
 * has already dropped, and guessing in either direction would change what the
