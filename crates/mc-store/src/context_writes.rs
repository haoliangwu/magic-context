//! Compartment writes that change both files: the cache state in `store.db` and the
//! session's history rows in `context.db`.
//!
//! The two files never commit together. Each such write therefore runs in three steps:
//!
//! 1. one `store.db` transaction does the checks (row version, historian phase, revert
//!    epoch), the cache changes, and records the `context.db` half as a pending row in
//!    `mc_single_store_pending_publish`;
//! 2. one `context.db` transaction applies that half;
//! 3. the pending row is deleted.
//!
//! A process that stops between steps leaves the pending row behind. The next write for
//! the session, the next transform pass for it, and the module's start all re-run step 2
//! from the row and then step 3, and no new write for the session starts while it exists.
//! Every `context.db` half is written so a second application finds nothing left to do:
//! compartments are compared with what is already stored, updated in place (keeping their
//! ids, so chunk embeddings survive) or inserted, and only rows that really changed count.
//!
//! Any rewrite of a compartment the session already had appends an `m0_mutation_log` row
//! in the same `context.db` transaction. That row is how every reader of the session
//! (TypeScript mode and this module alike) notices an in-place rewrite that the highest
//! compartment sequence alone would not reveal.
