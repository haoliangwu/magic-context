/**
 * Oh My Pi (OMP) 18.8.6 stops waiting after 30s without cancelling the context handler.
 * Cooperatively finish mandatory work by 25s (5s host margin); stop optional work at 21s.
 * Mandatory tagging/reclaim and final publication share the 25s outcome clock.
 * At expiry the fallback is a synchronous, storage-independent visible refusal.
 * The real OMP held-writer edge probe measured 4ms for that fallback and 25.745s
 * from handler entry to refusal, including probe instrumentation: 4.255s below
 * OMP's 30s deadline. This is one Mac observation, not a Windows upper bound.
 * Writer admission retains the shared helper's 16.5s ceiling but reserves 2s of mandatory work:
 * the measured non-wait maximum was 0.822s, so this reserve is over twice that.
 * Synchronous host/native calls cannot be preempted by these checkpoints or timers.
 * The independent dispatch receipt fence is the backstop after synchronous stalls.
 * Plain Pi has no handler deadline; these cooperative budgets apply there too.
 * These are initial engineering budgets, not Windows latency percentiles.
