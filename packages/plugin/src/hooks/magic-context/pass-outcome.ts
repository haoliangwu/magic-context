/**
 * What a recorded degradation can do to the request the pass serves, compared
 * with the request a healthy pass would serve.
 *
 * - `changes-request`: the stage that failed decides bytes the request depends
 *   on (persisted drops and truncations, the history cut, the session-history
 *   head messages m[0]/m[1], and the reasoning, image and ctx_reduce strips
 *   replayed from earlier passes), so the served request can be larger than a
 *   healthy one or differ from it. With compaction enabled, failed stages
 *   replay the last-good request or refuse, regardless of the context limit.
 * - `served`: the request equals a healthy pass's, or a healthy pass's minus
 *   text appended to a new, never-served turn, so it can be neither larger nor
 *   different in anything already served. The pass is served as a healthy one
 *   would be, over the limit or not.
 *
 * Every site a pass records is listed here, with its verdict from
 * docs/reports/degraded-pass-fail-open.md. Recording a site that is not listed
 * does not type-check, so a new site cannot join or skip the size guard
 * without a verdict.
